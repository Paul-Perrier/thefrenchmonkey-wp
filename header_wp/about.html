        Hi, my name is Constantin Paschou, I'm a visual artist based in Athens Greece. I was originally born and raised in Grenoble, France until I became 13. I'm a Self-Taught artist.  I started a couple years back with photography and I slowly learned about lighting,  compositing and retouching.</br></br>I always tend to find new ways of presenting ideas so I also 
        learned about designing, 3d modeling and animating stuff in a 3D environment. I'd like to think that I'm moving toward being a director and making shorts film… I guess we will see in the future.

          After so many years of uploading my creations all over the internet, I felt the need to  have them on a single platform. I finally managed to make my own website and now all my stuff are categories and arranged where they belong. It was a pain in the ass, but worth it… hopefully!

          I have some knowledge so I thought let's make videos about how to make the things I do, so yeah… I will have more updates about that soon, since I didn't really started yet!
